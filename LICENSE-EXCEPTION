Sonora Output Exception (Additional Permission)

This file grants an additional permission under GNU AGPLv3 section 7.

Scope

- “Sonora” means this repository’s contents, including its tools and specification templates.
- “Output” means any files and/or repositories generated or modified by running Sonora’s tooling
  (for example, `tools/bootstrap.py`) against a user-provided configuration, including placeholder
  substitution and scaffolding performed by that tooling.

Additional permission

You may create, use, distribute, and/or license the Output under terms of your choice, including
proprietary terms, without the Output itself becoming subject to the AGPL solely because it was
produced using Sonora.

Limitations

- This exception does not apply to Sonora itself or to modifications of Sonora. If you modify Sonora
  and convey it to others, or provide it for use over a network in a way that triggers the AGPL’s
  source-offer requirements, you must comply with the AGPL for those modifications.
- This exception does not grant permission to remove or alter copyright notices in Sonora.

No warranty

Sonora and its Output are provided “AS IS”, without warranty of any kind, to the extent permitted by law.
