description: >
  Authentication and authorization domain. Serves a dual role:
  (1) Infrastructure role — sole issuer of access tokens (JWT) and refresh
      tokens; publishes JWKS and manages key rotation. Consumed indirectly by
      all domain services via mw.auth middleware.
  (2) Domain role — manages user lifecycle (registration, activation,
      deactivation) and auth session lifecycle (authentication, token refresh,
      token revocation) through direct API interactions.
