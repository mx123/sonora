title: Tenant isolation is enforced via mandatory tenant_id claim
status: proposed
priority: high
statement: >
  Every request authenticated via JWT must include a valid tenant_id claim.
  Domain services must enforce tenant isolation: access to resources of a
  different tenant is forbidden by default.
acceptance_criteria:
  - "Requests without a tenant_id claim are rejected."
  - "Requests where tenant_id does not match the targeted resource tenant are rejected."
  - "Client-supplied tenant context must not override the tenant_id claim."
notes: >
  This rule applies across all domain services and is enforced at the domain
  boundary; API gateway checks may exist but do not replace domain enforcement.
