title: Shell-based federated UI composition (web and mobile)
status: proposed

  - CTX-0001
description: >
  Compose multiple domain-owned UI modules into a single end-user application via
  a dedicated Shell application. Domains ship independently and integrate only
  through explicit UI entrypoint contracts, without direct cross-domain UI
  dependencies.
acceptance_criteria:
  - "A Shell application hosts navigation, authentication integration, and global theming."
  - "Each domain UI exposes an explicit entrypoint (e.g., mount(context)) and can be loaded independently."
  - "Domains do not directly import or couple to other domains' UI code; integration happens only via the Shell."
  - "Cross-domain communication occurs only via Shell-mediated navigation and event contracts."
  - "Shared libraries are limited to stateless primitives (types, design tokens, logging), not business UI components."
