title: Acceptance tests become mandatory when code appears
status: approved
category: quality-gates
statement: >
  Once backend/frontend code is present, acceptance tests must exist and pass in CI
  for changes affecting implemented capabilities.
metric: acceptance_tests_ci
target: pass
scope:
  - backend
  - frontend
rationale: >
  Prevents "implemented" from drifting away from verified behavior as code starts to exist.
