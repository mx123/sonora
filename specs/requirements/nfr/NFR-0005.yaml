title: Services are independently deployable and recoverable
status: approved
category: reliability
statement: >
  Services must be independently deployable without disruptions to other services.
  Services must start, stop, and recover independent of the state of any other services,
  including shared "commons" libraries (e.g., logging).
metric: service_independence
target: pass
scope:
  - backend
  - deployment
rationale: >
  Prevents hidden runtime coupling and enables safe incremental delivery.
