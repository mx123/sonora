title: Event collection is server-side and consolidated
status: proposed
category: observability
statement: >
  All events must be collected once and on the server side.
  Collection from the front-end is permitted only when there are no corresponding API calls
  made from the front-end.
  Event consolidation, transformation, and distribution tools must be used.
metric: server_side_event_collection
target: pass
scope:
  - backend
  - frontend
  - deployment
rationale: >
  Improves event quality and governance, and reduces double-counting and client-side loss.
