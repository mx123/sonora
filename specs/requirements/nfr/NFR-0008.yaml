title: Correlation IDs are present end-to-end
status: proposed
category: observability
statement: >
  All APIs, messages, database requests, logs, and other relevant operations must carry a
  correlation_id that allows cross-referencing across API, service, and database calls.
  All requests and updates in the system must be correlated with the user and the customer
  when possible.
metric: correlation_id_coverage
target: "100% of production requests"
scope:
  - backend
  - deployment
rationale: >
  Enables efficient debugging, auditing, and analytics across distributed components.
