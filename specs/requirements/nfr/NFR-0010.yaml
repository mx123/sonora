title: Production services support standardized logging and tracing
status: proposed
category: observability
statement: >
  All production services must support standardized logging.
  Logging levels should be dynamically configurable without deployment.
  Logging should allow tracing a request through different services via a trace_id.
metric: standardized_logging
target: "100% of production services"
scope:
  - backend
  - deployment
rationale: >
  Supports incident response, performance analysis, and root-cause investigation.
