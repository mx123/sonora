title: Root Gradle Wrapper and centralized aggregate tasks
status: approved
category: maintainability
statement: >
  The repository must provide a Gradle Wrapper at the repo root and use it as the
  primary entrypoint for Gradle execution. Aggregate tasks that coordinate work
  across multiple modules/areas (e.g., build/test/check) must be defined centrally
  in a single place; submodules may define only local tasks.
metric: gradle_wrapper_and_aggregate_tasks
target: pass
scope:
  - ci
  - backend
  - frontend
  - tools
rationale: >
  Ensures deterministic, repeatable builds and prevents fragmented build orchestration
  as the system evolves from monolith to partially distributed deployment.
