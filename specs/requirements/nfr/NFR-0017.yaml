title: OS-agnostic developer and CI tooling (Gradle-first)
status: approved
category: maintainability
statement: >
  Project tooling must be OS-agnostic: core build and check workflows must be
  invokable in a cross-platform way, primarily via Gradle tasks (using the Gradle
  Wrapper), without requiring OS-specific bash/bat scripts for local development.
  CI may use bash internally, but bash must not become a prerequisite for local usage.
metric: os_agnostic_gradle_first_tooling
target: pass
scope:
  - ci
  - backend
  - frontend
  - tools
rationale: >
  Enables consistent developer experience across operating systems and reduces
  environment-specific drift while keeping CI implementation flexible.
