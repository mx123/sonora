title: Domain services validate JWTs locally using cached JWKS (fail-closed)
status: proposed
category: security
statement: >
  Domain services must validate JWT access tokens locally (signature, issuer,
  audience, and expiration) using cached public keys (JWKS) obtained from the
  Auth Domain. Domain services must not require synchronous calls to the Auth
  Domain to authorize requests. If a token cannot be validated, the service must
  reject the token and deny the request (fail-closed).
metric: jwt_validation_auth_domain_sync_calls
target: "0"
scope:
  - backend
  - integration-tests
rationale: >
  Preserves domain statelessness and availability while keeping strong security
  guarantees in clustered and elastic deployments.
