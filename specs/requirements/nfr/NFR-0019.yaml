title: Serialized JWT length is bounded; no PII in JWT claims
status: approved
category: security
statement: >
  Serialized JWTs (as transmitted, measured in bytes) should typically be within
  1024–2048 B. Serialized JWTs must not exceed 4096 B. Any JWT larger than 4096 B
  must be rejected (hard-fail). JWTs must not contain PII (e.g., email address,
  phone number, full name, postal address) or domain business data.
metric: serialized_jwt_length_bytes
target: "recommended: 1024–2048 B; max: 4096 B; >4096 => hard-fail"
scope:
  - backend
  - integration-tests
rationale: >
  Controls JWT bloat (especially with multi-tenant scopes) and reduces accidental
  sensitive data leakage through tokens.
