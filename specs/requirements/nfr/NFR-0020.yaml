title: Federated UI composition enforces strict domain boundaries
status: approved
category: maintainability
statement: >
  When multiple domain-owned UIs are composed into one product, the composition
  model must enforce strict boundaries: the Shell owns routing, global layout,
  theming, and authentication integration; domains integrate only through explicit
  UI entrypoint contracts and Shell-mediated events/navigation. Domains must not
  directly import other domains' UI code, share global mutable UI state, or share
  business UI components across domains.
metric: ui_boundary_violations
target: "0"
scope:
  - frontend
rationale: >
  Prevents coupling and release coordination across domains while maintaining a
  coherent product experience.
