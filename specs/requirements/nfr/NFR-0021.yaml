title: Errors are standardized and localizable across channels
status: approved
category: reliability
statement: >
  All externally observable errors (HTTP APIs, UI surfaces, messaging failure events,
  and adapter boundaries) must follow a single canonical error model. For HTTP,
  errors must use RFC 9457 Problem Details (application/problem+json) and include
  stable machine-readable error codes plus localization intent (translation key
  and parameters). For non-HTTP channels, an aligned Problem envelope must be used.
  User-facing text must be localizable via keys/params, with optional safe fallback
  text when needed.

  - adapters
rationale: >
  Prevents cross-domain inconsistency, enables localization without redeploying
  UI bundles, improves supportability via stable codes and correlation IDs, and
  reduces security risk from leaking internal details.
