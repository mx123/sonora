# Spec Rules

This folder is reserved for additional machine-checkable governance rules beyond JSON Schema.

Examples (future):
- naming conventions
- bounded-context dependency rules
- compatibility rules per delta type

- `error-registry.md` — conventions/registry for error codes, problem types, and i18n keys (ADR-0007)
