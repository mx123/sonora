# Spec Rules

This folder is reserved for additional machine-checkable governance rules beyond JSON Schema.

Examples (future):
- naming conventions
- bounded-context dependency rules
- compatibility rules per delta type

See also:
- `error-registry.md` — conventions/registry for error codes, problem types, and i18n keys (ADR-0007)

New (baseline reset):
- `repo-index.md` — non-SSOT repository index contract (`repo.yaml`)
- `quality-gates.md` — tool-neutral quality gate IDs (`qg.*`) and semantics
- `workspace-registry.md` — central multi-repo registry rules (under `specs/registry/`)
